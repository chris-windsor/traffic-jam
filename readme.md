# traffic-jam

the purpose of this project is to simulate an order processing system for an
ecommerce store

we want to simultaneously process multiple orders while maintaining the queue
they were received in and preventing overdrafts of the inventory

some of the implementations in this are naive or primitive. it is solely for
demonstration purposes and is expected to be expanded upon
